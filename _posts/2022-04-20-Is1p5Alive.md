title: Is 1.5 Alive?
---


COP26 closed in November 2021. In its aftermath, the goal of 1.5°C staggers on, just about alive according to many. However, every serious analysis agrees that current progress on emissions reductions falls well short of the 1.5°C target. With every passing year the required change of direction for a 1.5°C world becomes more ambitious, and the dependence on large-scale use of negative emissions technologies becomes larger.

New pledges made at and before the conference have put us on a “path towards” between 1.8°C and 2.4°C by the year 2100, according to the UN, revised down from the post-Paris trajectory of 2.7°C. This projection, though, assumes all countries around the world make good on their pledged but mostly unstarted emissions reductions. Under current policies, [analysis at Carbon Brief](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-do-cop26-promises-keep-global-warming-below-2c) suggests we are on course for 2.7°C instead. And a real sceptic might ask what happens if we extrapolate recent emissions trends out forwards in time. Well, despite real progress in some areas, and lots of talk in many more areas, global emissions have been [pretty flat for about a decade now](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions). If emissions continue at this level we are on course for perhaps 3–4°C by 2100.

That was a lot of temperatures, and you could be forgiven if your eyes glazed over a little. But these differences matter. Increases in insect species loss and human exposure to extreme heat are both predicted to be around 3 times worse in a 2°C world than a 1.5°C one. Summer arctic sea ice is predicted to disappear by mid-century under scenarios corresponding to 3°C warming by 2100, but some ice would likely hang on in a 2°C scenario.

The key point of the above is that it’s vital to separate out hopes for future pledges (a 1.5°C course) from current pledges (<2°C), and then to separate those pledges from the policies in place (>2.5°C), and finally those policies from achieved emissions reductions (>3°C). Targets are easier to make than to achieve. It is when detailed policies are brought in and solutions are deployed that opposition tends to arise.

All over the world, there is a significant credibility gap between promises that have been made and action on the ground. Under the Paris agreement, countries are required to set out their planned emissions reductions in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). In many cases, these NDCs fall short of net zero pledges which have been subsequently made, with many of those net zero pledges currently without legal backing or any form of detailed plans.

The lack of detailed plans to back up targets matters because without them there’s no way to hold a government to account for its progress in the short term. And these transitions simply can’t happen overnight. For example, take the decarbonisation of heating. You need to stop selling gas boilers about 15 years before you turn off the last methane supply to homes, if you want to avoid wasting millions of working heating systems. On top of that, it might take a decade or more to develop the supply chain for an alternative technology to the point it can take over the market. In the UK, we need to scale up annual heat pump sales by around two orders of magnitude from the 10,000s to nearly 2 million, in order to replace the current annual boiler sales. Put those two things together and you find that if governments don’t take the necessary first steps 20–30 years ahead of the target date, i.e. NOW, they will miss those targets.

In some ways the UK is actually doing quite well in this area. Our 2050 net zero target has legal backing and is accompanied by at least some sector plans such as the recent [Heat and Buildings Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/heat-and-buildings-strategy), and there are [detailed reports](https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/net-zero-technical-report/) by the independent Committee on Climate Change which provide a good yardstick by which to measure progress. However, what [that yardstick shows](https://www.theccc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Progress-in-reducing-emissions-2021-Report-to-Parliament.pdf) is that despite some real progress, the UK is already starting to fall short of its trajectory to net zero, with the majority of emissions mitigation actions required by 2030 “falling behind” or “at risk of falling behind”. This gap includes, amongst other things, insufficient planned investment in heat pumps, industrial decarbonisation and carbon capture and storage. Moreover, for the most part, these assessments of progress measure announced policies against the implied level of policy required by targets. But even announced policies with funding behind them can fail in the real world. See the recent debacle over the Green Homes Grants scheme in the UK, where the government tried and failed to literally give away free money to homeowners.

So what does all of this mean for the 1.5°C goal?

One last complication we must consider is that on top of the uncertainty in CO2 emissions pathways there are other climate affecting emissions, which make a big difference in the short term. Several major pollutant aerosols currently cool the planet by reflecting away sunlight. As emissions of these aerosols are phased out we will experience a warming effect, of around 0.25–0.5°C. On the other hand, methane in the atmosphere is pushing temperatures up, likely by a similar amount, and would fall out of the atmosphere in several decades were we to stop emitting. Together, these mean that over the next decade or two, the _relative rates_ of reductions in emissions of CO2, methane, and cooling pollutants matter a lot for temperature. It’s an underappreciated fact that were we to cut both CO2 emissions and aerosol emissions to zero today, but maintain the current atmospheric concentration of other greenhouse gases such as methane, then our historic emissions of CO2 would already see us pass the 1.5°C threshold. This is shown in the figure below, taken from the [Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change’s special report: Global Warming of 1.5°C](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/chapter-1/).

This is a complex figure, but it’s an important one. What it means is that it’s already too late to stay below 1.5°C just by cutting CO2 emissions. And for every year after 2020 in which our CO2 emissions are more than zero, we rely more and more heavily on some combination of deep cuts to methane emissions, CO2 removal, or artificially maintaining/expanding the aerosol cooling effect (e.g. by solar geoengineering) to stay under that limit.

Putting everything together, we see that the 1.5°C goal is technically achievable, but will take a rapid ramp up of action far beyond the real progress made at COP26. Ultimately though, every tenth of a degree of warming matters. If in several decades the earth passes the 1.5°C threshold, that will only make emissions reductions more urgent.
