# New paper - Solar Geoengineering in the Polar Regions, A Review

Our review examines in some detail what we know so far about the expected polar climate response to solar geoengineering. We focus on SAI, considering both global and more localised deployments, but also consider some other potential methods, such as marine cloud brightening and cirrus cloud thinning. 

The aim here was to provide a comprehensive overview of the solar geongineering literature as it pertains to the Arctic and Antarctic climate response, and we considered the evidence on change in sea-ice, land-ice, permafrost, ocean circulation and high latitude hydrology, alongside the familiar temperature response. We also considered the differences between the polar response to global, versus more targeted SAI using high latitude injection. 

Overall we argue that:
- Global solar geoengineering, if technically feasible, would likely reduce the rapid climate change ongoing in the Arctic and Antarctic
- Targeted solar geoengineering strategies would be needed to avoid residual warming in the polar regions
- No truly localized polar geoengineering proposal has been shown viable for restoring climate on a pan-Arctic or Antarctic scale

Another key message is simply that, as ever with intervention in the climate system, *it's complicated*, and there are lots of moving parts, which we tried to demonstrate with out final figure:
